## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Tagline on landing page, not Branding mode: Tagline describes core value (universal), not just branding use case
- Keep Self-Reflection as third interface: Extends psychometrics to personal domain, differentiates from competitors
- Interface differentiation via UX framing, not backend changes: Backend (multiExtract, intent routing) is universal; context varies by use case
- Clean URL routing without query params: Professional UX, session state managed internally
- Prioritize stability audit before new features: Must understand current system before extending it

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

None identified during roadmap creation.
