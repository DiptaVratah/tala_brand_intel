  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Start the server if not running:**
```bash
cd /Users/dipta/tala_brand_intel && node server.js
```

**Test each mode thoroughly:**

### 1. Branding Mode (/branding)
- [ ] URL shows `/branding`
- [ ] Mode switcher shows blue indicator dot
- [ ] Primary button says "Build Brand Voice" (not "Mirror My Voice")
- [ ] Button is blue (#3b82f6)
- [ ] Enter sample text, click analyze
- [ ] Loading shows "Analyzing brand voice..."
- [ ] After analysis, DNA section shows "Brand DNA"
- [ ] Save the kit - toast shows "Brand profile saved!"
- [ ] If empty, Voice Library shows "No Brand Kits Yet" empty state
- [ ] Typography feels professional (tighter, bolder headings)

### 2. Author Mode (/author)
- [ ] URL shows `/author`
- [ ] Mode switcher shows red indicator dot
- [ ] Primary button says "Craft Writing Voice"
- [ ] Button is red (#ef4444)
- [ ] Enter sample text, click analyze
- [ ] Loading shows "Capturing your style..."
- [ ] After analysis, DNA section shows "Voice DNA"
- [ ] Tagline text uses serif font (Georgia)
- [ ] Line height feels more relaxed/literary

### 3. Self-Reflection Mode (/self-reflection)
- [ ] URL shows `/self-reflection`
- [ ] Mode switcher shows green indicator dot
- [ ] Primary button says "Discover Inner Voice"
- [ ] Button is green (#10b981)
- [ ] Enter sample text, click analyze
- [ ] Loading shows "Reflecting on your words..."
- [ ] After analysis, DNA section shows "Identity DNA"
- [ ] Buttons have more rounded corners
- [ ] Overall feel is softer/more supportive

### 4. Cross-Mode Verification
- [ ] Switching modes via dropdown updates all language immediately
- [ ] Browser back/forward works between modes
- [ ] Landing page (/) shows only 3 mode cards (no Consciousness/Deep)
- [ ] Mode switcher only shows 3 options (no Consciousness/Deep)
- [ ] Konami code still activates Deep mode (easter egg preserved)

### 5. Error Handling
- [ ] Trigger an error (e.g., empty input analysis)
- [ ] Error toast appears with mode-appropriate prefix:
  - Branding: "Brand voice extraction failed: ..."
  - Author: "Writing voice capture failed: ..."
  - Self-Reflection: "Reflection analysis failed: ..."
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if all checks pass.

If issues found, describe them:
- Which mode(s) have problems
- What specifically is wrong
- What you expected vs what you see
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>
